Have you ever tried to resize an image and it got distorted or lost a bit of quality? Vector graphics are the answer, as they are composed of things such as lines and shapes based on mathematical formulas. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but, in short, they allow you to work with them without having to worry about quality loss.
