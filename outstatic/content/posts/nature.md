**Nature**, in the broadest sense, is the [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) world or [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe). "Nature" can refer to the [phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature#cite_note-What_does_nature_mean-1)
